# Sleep Analyser
- I created this short script to analyse my chat exports from WA to find out when I went to bed and when I got up.
- Processed over 6 months' worth of data, which ended up being more than 140 data points.
- The data has first to be sorted, filtered and then some calculations were done to create in the end data in two columns - the date and the time when I went to bed/woke up.
- Then I created and exported that data into csv files through the script only, and then visualized the data there using charts and graphs.

## Here are the results -
